# cs210
assignment for cs210
This was a project for cs210 in which the task was to make a applicatiob that would let you search foods and see inforamtion based on which section you chose.

What I did Well
For me what I did well was plan out this project as I knew the task would look intense but I was able to plan out ewach step and firgure out what each piece of code would be responsible for before trying to sit down and code everything at once.

Enhance code.
I probably could have made the main look better as to me it looked a bit of a mess and not as clean as my function. I feel like someone could get easily lost even with comments in the code.

The most challenging
For me it was making the function work properly as there was alot so making sure code dindt break or making sure all of the pieces to this puzzle fit as they should.

skill
The best skils from this project will easily be making the code look uniform. This is something that is importatn for any code as the abilty to pass on code is crucial for newcomers.

Maintainable readable adaptable.
This code is great for edit and easily maintainable. It is not to big so if you do get lost you can come back around and find out what needs to changed. The code is something that has pretty secure functions but the main is something that i feel could break if changed and is something that I would like to fix.
